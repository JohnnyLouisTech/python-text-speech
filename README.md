# python-text-speech
## Project Description:
Developed a Python script that fetches jokes from the "Official Joke API", processes the retrieved JSON data, and then narrates the jokes using text-to-speech technology. The script utilizes the requests and json modules to retrieve and parse the joke data, while pyttsx3 is employed for the text-to-speech functionality. Additionally, a Joke class is defined to encapsulate each joke's setup and punchline, enhancing code readability and organization. This project demonstrates proficiency in web data retrieval, JSON parsing, object-oriented programming, and integration of text-to-speech capabilities in Python.

Run the provided Python code:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.
Copy and paste the provided code into the editor.
Save the file with a .py extension, for example, joke_script.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script using the cd command.
Run the script by typing python textspeech.py (however you saved) and press Enter.
The script will execute, fetching jokes from the API, processing the data, and narrating the jokes using text-to-speech.


** Ensure you have an active internet connection while running the script to fetch jokes from the API. Additionally, you may need to install the required Python packages (requests and pyttsx3) if you haven't already. You can install them using pip
